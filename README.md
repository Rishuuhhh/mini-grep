# Mini Grep

## Status
Work in progress

## Description
Mini Grep is a command-line text search utility inspired by the Unix `grep` tool.
The project focuses on implementing pattern searching in text files using C++, while strengthening understanding of file handling, string processing, and command-line programs.

## Objectives
- Understand how text-search utilities work internally  
- Practice efficient file reading and string matching  
- Build familiarity with command-line tools  

## Planned Features
- Sear# Mini Grep
